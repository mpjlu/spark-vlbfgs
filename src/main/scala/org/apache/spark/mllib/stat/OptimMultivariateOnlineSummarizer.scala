/**
 * :: DeveloperApi ::
 * OptimMultivariateOnlineSummarizer implements [[MultivariateStatisticalSummary]] to compute the mean,
 * variance, minimum, maximum, counts, and nonzero counts for instances in sparse or dense vector
 * format in an online fashion.
 *
 * Two OptimMultivariateOnlineSummarizer can be merged together to have a statistical summary of
 * the corresponding joint dataset.
 *
 * A numerically stable algorithm is implemented to compute the mean and variance of instances:
 * Reference: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance variance-wiki]]
 * Zero elements (including explicit zero values) are skipped when calling add(),
 * to have time complexity O(nnz) instead of O(n) for each column.
 *
 * For weighted instances, the unbiased estimation of variance is defined by the reliability
 * weights: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean#Reliability_weights]].
